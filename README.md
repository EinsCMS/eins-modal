# The last modal / alert / dialog you will ever need!

## Full Documentation: [https://www.einscms.com/modal](https://www.einscms.com/modal)

EinsModal is the best solution to interact with your users.

It works on every browser and device! (Internet Explorer >= 9)

"Eins" is german and means "one".

This software is part of the Eins-Software-Family.

Every Eins-Software-Product aims to be the one and only software solution you will ever need regarding its task.

## Why EinsModal?

There are many other modal / dialog / popup libraries out there and we tried some of them. 

So what is the need and purpose of this library?

We needed a solution that is **production ready**, **easy to use**, **extensible** and has **beautiful design and animation**.

1. Animations and Design

    EinsModal has **50 animations / transitions** and a **Dark & Light theme** build in.

    Most of the Libraries out there lack good looking design and/or have no or poor animations.

2. Browser Support

    EinsModal is **responsive** (all device sizes) and **works on all browsers** (>= IE9)!

    Almost all other libraries lack support for legacy browsers like IE9 and they also have bugs in newer browsers.

3. Production Ready

    EinsModal is production ready and stable.

    We sometimes need a Modal to display or provide critical information and functionality to our users. So it has to work 100% of the time. Bugs are not acceptable.

4. Easy to use

    EinsModal **can be used without any javascript knowledge**.

    Most of the other libraries can only be used and configured by writing your own javascript code.

5. Extensibility 

    EinsModal provides a developer-friendly api that allows you to extend and use the libraries in many different ways.

    It also has just a small amount of CSS / SCSS. Overriding or extending it is very easy!
